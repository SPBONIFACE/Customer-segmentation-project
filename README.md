# Customer segmentation project

The current project presents a segmentation problem. The objective of segmentation is to segment customers, people or items into different clusters based on certain attributes. This exercise is quite common in Marketing when launching promotions in order to target similar customers with specific ads, promotions.

The dataset used was download from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

My aim is not just to segment customers into different clusters /
segments (this is where usually most tutorials stop) but also to explain how clusters are determined.
